# Unity Learning Programming Course
Repository of my Unity Learning Programming Course Scripts and some other associated files, most of them use Unity 2018 since the course work is from then 
and most of my code in the the tutorial was pretty much used as a refresher course on Unity since I have been programming on Unity and using their tutorials since the original Roll-A-Ball tutorial. So you won't find anything very fancy within this rep, it does however contain the entire course solutions.
